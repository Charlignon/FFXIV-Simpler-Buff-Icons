# How to update
Because I will not remember in 6 months

1. Update the master sheet with the new data in tab "Ally buffs"
2. For each role, copy the output from tab "OUTPUT"
3. Paste the json outputs in their respective files in `./Simpler Buff Icons/group_00x_<ROLE>.json`
4. Once done, compress `./Simpler Buff Icons` into a .zip, then change the file extension to .pmp. Move it to your mod folder
5. Start the game with Dalamud+Penumbra enabled. You can stay on main screen
6. In Penumbra:
  - Delete the old mod
  - Import the new .pmp
  - (optional) Go to Advanced Settings > Duplicate > Deduplicate (iirc it's done during import now)
  - (optional) Update version / mod details
  - Export the mod
7. Copy newly exported .pmp to `../build`, and extract/replace old files
8. Thank your past self for writing this guide
